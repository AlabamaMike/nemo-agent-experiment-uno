## Integration Architecture

### Data Flow
```
GitHub Events → Webhook Handler → Sync Manager → Project Registry
                                        ↓
                              Performance Tracker ← Metrics Bridge
```

## Metrics Summary

- **Total New Code**: ~3,150 lines
- **Components**: 5 major modules
- **Classes**: 20+
- **Methods**: 120+
- **Event Handlers**: 17
- **Conflict Strategies**: 5

## Sass Integration

### GitHub Event Responses
- Push events: "Another fix? Maybe try not breaking it first time."
- Large PRs: "This PR is larger than my patience. Split it up."
- Build failures: "What a surprise. Did you test locally?"
- Stale issues: "This issue is so old it's growing moss"

### Escalation Triggers
- Production deployments (sass level 7)
- Build failures (sass level 9)
- Security issues (sass level 10)

## Performance Impact

### On Agents
- Automatic performance updates from GitHub activity
- Strike system integration for build failures
- Commendation system for quality contributions
- Collaboration scoring from PR reviews

### On Projects
- Real-time health updates
- Velocity tracking from commits
- Quality metrics from PR reviews
- Risk assessment from issues

## Configuration Examples

### GitHub Setup
```python
github = GitHubAdapter(
    token="github_token",
    organization="your-org"
)

# Register with sync manager
sync_manager.register_platform(Platform.GITHUB, github)

# Map contributors to agents
bridge.map_contributor_to_agent("developer1", "agent-001")
```

### Webhook Configuration
```python
webhook_handler = WebhookHandler(
    secret="webhook_secret",
    sass_engine=brenda.sass_engine
)

# Process webhook
result = webhook_handler.process_webhook(
    event_type="pull_request",
    payload=github_payload
)
```

### Project Registration
```python
project = registry.register_project(
    name="BrendaCore",
    description="Sassy PM Agent",
    platforms=["github", "jira"],
    team_members=["dev1", "dev2"]
)
```
