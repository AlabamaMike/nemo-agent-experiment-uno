- Brenda can now receive and make phone calls
- Voice parameters dynamically adjust based on sass level
- Emotional state affects voice delivery

### 2. Context Preservation
- Conversations maintain context across voice and text channels
- Message history tracked across all interactions

### 3. Security & Authentication
- Voice biometric authentication support
- Webhook signature verification
- Secure configuration management

### 4. Production Readiness
- Comprehensive error handling
- Metrics collection and reporting
- Health check endpoints
- Graceful shutdown handling

## API Endpoints

### Webhook Server Endpoints
- `POST /webhooks/cartesia` - Main webhook handler
- `GET /webhooks/health` - Health check
- `GET /webhooks/metrics` - Metrics dashboard

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Required
CARTESIA_API_KEY         # Cartesia API key
CARTESIA_WEBHOOK_SECRET  # Webhook signing secret
CARTESIA_PHONE_NUMBER    # Assigned phone number

# Optional
WEBHOOK_PORT            # Server port (default: 8080)
BRENDA_ENV             # Environment (development/staging/production)
WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_URL     # Public URL for webhooks
HUMAN_OPERATOR_NUMBER  # Transfer target for escalations
```

## Running Phase 2

### Development Mode
```bash
# Set test environment variables
export CARTESIA_API_KEY=test_key
export CARTESIA_WEBHOOK_SECRET=test_secret
export CARTESIA_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890

# Run tests
python tests/test_voice_integration.py

# Start server
python launch_brenda_voice.py
```

### Production Mode
```bash
# Set production variables
export BRENDA_ENV=production
export CARTESIA_API_KEY=<real_key>
export CARTESIA_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<real_secret>
export CARTESIA_PHONE_NUMBER=<real_number>

# Start with monitoring
python launch_brenda_voice.py
```

## Integration Points

### With Phase 1 (Core)
- BrendaAgent processes all requests
- SassEngine provides quips for voice
- MemoryStore tracks voice interactions

### For Phase 3 (Agent Management)
- Voice channel ready for agent status updates
- Call metrics available for performance tracking
- Escalation system integrated

### For Phase 4 (PM Tools)
- Voice interface for GitHub/Jira updates
- Phone-based project status reports
- Voice authentication for secure operations

## Notable Features

### 1. Adaptive Sass Delivery
Voice characteristics change based on:
- Current sass level
- Project health
- Caller behavior
- Conversation context

### 2. Smart Interruption Handling
- High sass = less patience for interruptions
- Crisis mode allows almost no interruptions
- Patient mode tolerates more interruptions

### 3. Emphasis Patterns
Special phrases get emphasis:
- "obviously" - elongated with pause
- "seriously" - higher emphasis, lower pitch
- "whatever" - fast delivery, dismissive tone
- "great/wonderful/perfect" - maximum sarcasm when sass is high

### 4. Escalation Calling
Brenda can call humans when needed:
- Priority-based ring times
- Custom voicemail messages
- Retry logic for critical issues
- Sass level affects urgency of delivery

## Testing Results

All 10 test scenarios pass:
- ✅ Incoming Call Handling
- ✅ Voice Personality Mapping
- ✅ Sass Escalation
- ✅ Authentication Flow
- ✅ Message Bridging
- ✅ Outbound Escalation
- ✅ Webhook Handling
- ✅ Emotion Detection
- ✅ Interruption Handling
- ✅ Context Preservation

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

With voice integration complete, Phase 3 can:
1. Send agent status updates via voice
2. Receive voice commands for agent management
3. Provide voice-based performance reports
4. Enable voice-controlled blocker resolution
5. Implement voice-based Wall of Fame/Shame announcements

## Sass Quotes from Testing

- "Call me. Or don't. I'll be here either way."
- "Fine. Transferring you to someone with more patience."
- "Authentication failed. Try again or press 0 for a human."
- "Technical difficulties. How surprising. Try again later."
- "Don't call me when everything breaks."
